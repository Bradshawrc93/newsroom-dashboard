Core Features
1. Channel Connection

Users select and connect to specific Slack channels (e.g., squad/team-related ones).
Authenticate via Slack OAuth to fetch messages from selected channels.
Store connected channels in user config (e.g., a settings file).

2. Sorting and Filtering

Sort views by:

Person (sender).
Keyword (user-defined or learned).
Channel.


Additional filters: By squad/team, date range, importance (based on AI scoring or manual tags).
UI: Dropdowns or search bar for quick filtering.

3. Daily Rundown

Morning auto-refresh: Fetch yesterday's messages from connected channels.
Generate summaries per channel/squad using OpenAI (e.g., "Key updates from Squad A: [summary]").
Include quick links to original Slack threads/messages.
Greeting: "Good morning! Here's the progress on these teams and product workstreams from yesterday. In case you missed it, here were a couple of high-importance threads."
Highlight high-importance items (e.g., based on keywords like "urgent", "blocker", or learned patterns).

4. AI Integration (OpenAI)

Use for:

Summarizing threads/messages.
Detecting keywords, squads, or context (e.g., cross-functional topics).
Scoring importance.


Minimize calls: Only call AI for new/uncached messages; reuse learned associations.
Cache summaries and tags to avoid redundant API hits.

5. Learning and Tagging

Manual tagging: Users tag messages/threads with keywords (e.g., "squad-A", "bug-fix") via UI buttons.
Auto-learning: App associates senders with common teams/keywords (e.g., "User X usually posts about Squad B").
Handle context: If a message deviates (e.g., cross-functional), use keywords/content to override defaults.
Storage: Lightweight â€“ Append to a file/DB:

Slack message ID + keywords/tags.
Per-person common tags (e.g., {user: ["squad-A", "design"]}).
Per-thread summaries and associations.


Goal: Over time, app predicts tags without AI, only falling back for ambiguities.

6. UI Elements

Dashboard layout:

List view: Sender name + message snippet + quick link.
Toggle/expand: Show full thread follow-ups.
Summary button: AI-generated thread summary (cached if possible).


Nav bar: Left-side menu with sections like "Daily Rundown", "Search/Filter", "Settings", and empty slots for expansions (e.g., "Notion Integration").
Responsive design: Fast-loading, mobile-friendly for quick checks.

7. Search and Historical Summaries

Search by keyword, person, channel, or squad.
For historical views (e.g., past month): Pull cached data + Slack history API.
Generate on-demand dashboards: "Summary of key highlights and learnings from the past month per squad."
Output: Grouped summaries with links to threads.

8. Future Expansions

Notion Integration:

Connect Notion database via API.
Ingest weekly notes automatically (e.g., cron job).
Tag note sections with keywords/squads using AI (minimal calls).
Combined reports: Pull from Slack + Notion for timeframe/squad-based dashboards (e.g., "Monthly report for Squad A: Slack threads + Notion notes").


Nav bar slots: Add buttons/links for new features without cluttering core UI.

Technical Considerations

Efficiency:

Load quick: Fetch only recent/delta data from Slack API.
Cache everything: Use local storage for tags, summaries, and associations.
AI optimization: Batch calls, use cheaper models for simple tasks.


Data Storage:

Simple JSON file for starters: {messages: [{id: "123", tags: ["squad-A"], summary: "Brief text"}], users: { "userX": ["common-tags"] } }
Upgrade to DB if needed for scalability.


Security: Handle Slack tokens securely; anonymize data if sharing.

To-Dos / Instructions for Coding
This section is structured as actionable steps to "vibe code out." Start small: MVP with channel connection, basic fetching, and daily summary. Iterate from there.
Phase 1: Setup and Basics

 Set up project: Create repo with frontend (e.g., React) and backend (e.g., Node.js Express).
 Integrate Slack API: Use @slack/web-api for OAuth and fetching channels/messages.

To-do: Implement endpoint to list channels and save user selections.


 Basic UI: Dashboard skeleton with nav bar (use placeholders for expansions).

To-do: Add login button for Slack auth.



Phase 2: Data Fetching and Daily Rundown

 Fetch yesterday's messages: Use Slack conversations.history with time filters.

To-do: Cron job or on-load trigger for morning rundown.


 Integrate OpenAI: Use openai SDK for summarization.

To-do: Function to summarize threads; start with prompt like "Summarize this Slack thread: [messages]".


 Generate greeting and highlights: Parse summaries for importance (e.g., keyword scan before AI).

To-do: UI component for rundown display with links.



Phase 3: Sorting, Filtering, and UI Interactions

 Implement sorting/filtering: Use state management (e.g., Redux) for dynamic views.

To-do: Add dropdowns for person/keyword/channel; search bar.


 Thread UI: List items with expand toggle for replies.

To-do: Fetch replies via conversations.replies; add summary button that calls AI/caches.



Phase 4: Learning, Tagging, and Storage

 Tagging system: UI buttons to add tags; save to JSON file/DB.

To-do: Endpoint to update tags; auto-learn by aggregating tags per user/message.


 Caching: Store in local file (e.g., fs.writeFile for Node).

To-do: Check cache before AI calls; append new data lightly.


 Associations: Build user profiles from tags.

To-do: Logic to predict tags: If user common tag matches, apply; else AI fallback.



Phase 5: Search and Historical Features

 Search endpoint: Query cached data + Slack history.

To-do: Support keyword/squad searches; generate monthly summaries.


 Dashboard generation: On-demand views with grouped summaries.

To-do: UI page for historical reports.



Phase 6: Expansions and Polish

 Notion Integration: Use Notion API for fetching notes.

To-do: Auth flow; weekly ingest job; tagging with AI.
To-do: Combined report generator pulling Slack + Notion.


 Add nav bar slots: Dynamic menu for new features.
 Optimization: Profile load times; batch AI calls.
 Testing: Unit tests for API calls; UI tests for interactions.
 Deployment: Host on Vercel/Heroku; consider electron for desktop app vibe.
